Project Description:

This page is meant to display a list of image objects that are retrieved from a .json file using an asynchronous request ($.ajax()).

When the user selects a keyword from the dropdown, the images possessing a similar keyword description will remain displayed and all others will be hidden.

If the user selects the default dropdown keyword, then all photos are shown on the page again.
